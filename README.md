# BookShelf
Application for recording all books you've got at home. For when you're in the store and don't remember if you already have a specific book.
<br>This is a work in progress. <br>Focus will be on structure and tests. I'm trying out a TDD approach.
<br><br>It is using Maven, Spring-Boot and Spring-data-jpa
